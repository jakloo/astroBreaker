# Astro Breaker (prototype version)

A simple game for Cardboard VR on Android phones made in Unity.

## How to play
- The game starts automatically without a menu.
- The only controls are head (mouse in editor) movements.
- Placeholder spheres spawn pseudo-randomly in the space around you (not behind you though, no need to look back!)
