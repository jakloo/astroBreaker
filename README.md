# Astro Breaker (prototype version)

A simple game for Cardboard VR on Android phones made in Unity.

## How to play
- The game starts automatically without a menu.
- The only controls are head (mouse in editor) movements.
- Placeholder spheres spawn pseudo-randomly in the space around you (not behind you though, no need to look back!)
- Bottom left corner shows a color and number of spheres that you must find and destroy.
- You destroy a sphere by looking straight at it for one second.
- You get more points by destroying smaller and/or faster spheres.
